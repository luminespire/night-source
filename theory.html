									<h2>Thumb Layout Theory</h2>
									<p><i>This is going to be a very rough briefing on all the theory that I am aware of on thumb layouts. This will cover single-thumb only and will not include magic (and other multi-input or multi-layer layouts).</i></p>
									<h3>Letters for Thumb</h3>
									<p>The most commonly used letters for thumb layouts are <code>E, R, S, and N</code>. For this reason, I will discuss these letters first, then I will alphabetically discuss the rest.</p>
									<p><code>E</code>: The most commonly used thumb letter - used all the way back on the Maltron - <code>E</code> is a fundamentally logical choice. It is the most frequent of any letter, and interacts with everything (thus causing SFBs and SFSs). Removing this letter should lead to the lowest SFBs possible - and it does!... Theoretically. In practice, it creates a layout with such high SFSs that the about 0.03% decrease over the best of <code>R</code> (which has reasonable SFSs) just is not worth it. Furthermore, when implemented incorrectly, it tends to induce a LOT of redirects (again due to its frequency). Finally, in addition to all of these, <code>EE</code> is the third most common repeat bigram. For most people, while the thumb is very strong, it is not particularly fast; thus making it unideal to quickly type out a double letter. All in all, while <code>E</code> may seem tempting and logical to use (and in certain cases it still is), for the majority of people, other options are simply better.</p>
								    <p><code>R</code>: Generally accepted as the best letter (although better put, best researched), <code>R</code> is similar to <code>E</code> in the way that it interacts with everything, but comes at the advantage of not being hyper common (thus not causing so many redirects) and not repeating commonly. If you want 0% SFBs on Monkeytype (English-200), this is the most reasonable way to do it [Night does this!].</p>
									<p>Using <code>R</code> on thumb pushes <code>L</code> and <code>H</code> to be paired together (and thus usually <code>M</code>) if you want competitive statistics. Thus, <code>LHM | DTK</code> structure (or in the case of Night <code>LH | DTMK</code>) is forced making designs rather limited. This is primarily because <code>L</code> is unable to pair with anything else effectively.</p>
									<p><code>S</code>: Currently being experimented with, <code>S<code> is unique in that it purposely reintroduces a semi-common SFB, <code>RL | LR</p>, in order to achieve a better structure (by freeing up <code>H</code>). It will inherently have worse SFBs as removing <code>RL | LR</code> was the last major removable SFB (other than the vowels). However, it does tend to have lower SFSs.</p> 
								    <p><code>N</code>: Used in a few cases, <code>N</code> seems to be the best for low SFSs. This is because while <code>N</code></p>.
