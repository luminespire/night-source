									<h2>Night</h2>
									<h3>DTMK Index</h3>
									<pre>
<code>K Q
T M
D Z</code>
									</pre>
									<p>The primary focus of Night was having great stats (statistics) and focused finger usage. Night was intended to maximize index usage, while not being absured. The most common consonant and hence, commonly preferred index came to be <code>T</code> (see: Colemak). Of the letter pairings, <code>DTMK</code> was the most appropriate choice. <code>DTMK</code> allows for great stats while not requiring the usage of corner index keys. Having three high usage letters plus a fourth low usage key would already result in a good bit of movement; adding more, especially to the longer distance corner keys, could quickly overload the index and make it uncomfortable to use. Most of the SFSs generated from this setup can be alted. While it may seem strange to put <code>M</code> in the middle column causing more LSBs, the frequency of <code>M_D</code> such as <code>MAD</code> results in a higher movement distance (a lot of 2uSFSs) compared to adding just a bit more LSBs.</p>
									<h3>LHJ Middle</h3>
									<pre>
<code>L K Q
H T M
J D Z</code>
									</pre>
									<p>In most <code>R</code> letter-thumb utilizing layouts, <code>M</code> is paired with <code>L</code> and <code>H</code> . This is done due to the great stats it offers (exceptionally low SFBs for the frequency). However, this high usage naturally comes with the consequence of high movement. Thus, having this on the index would be ideal (see: [Dusk](https://altlayouts.com/dusk/)). However, the consequence of this setup is the lack of a fourth pairing - making an index setup wasteful. While <code>LHMK</code> is usable, statistically, <code>DTMK</code> is superior - it has greater usage on the homerow, <code>T</code> , and lower SFBs as a whole. Thus, Night simply omits <code>M</code> by having <code>LHJ</code> - <code>J</code> being considered a dead key due to it's insignificant usage - placed on the middle finger and its low interactions with <code>L</code> and <code>H</code> . A side advantage of this setup is the removal of middle-down scissors. </p>
                                    <h3>FSV Ring</h3>
									<pre>
<code>F L K Q
S H T M
V J D Z</code>
									</pre>
									<p>One of the most common layout setups has S on the pinky. This is chosen due to its lower usage compared to other consonants. Furthermore, the V key can be easily stacked on top of S for, again, near perfect stats. However, one consequence of using S on the pinky is its repeat commonality. SS is the fourth [MR Corpus] most common repeat letter right behind O. Although again usable, it is not ideal. Placing it on a stronger finger, like the ring, would work better. This is exactly what Night does. Beyond this, <code>S</code> also pairs well with <code>F</code>, again with great statistics. Thus, FSV was chosen for the ring finger.</p>
									<h3>BNX Pinky</h3>
									<pre>
<code>B F L K Q
N S H T M
X V J D Z</code>
									</pre>
									<p>Ultra low SFB and SFS, it is a great stack to use for pinky. The usage is reasonable and maintains only one non-dead letter not on the homerow, <code>B</code> .</p>
									<hr />
									<h3>Vowel Setup / Right Hand</h3>
									<p>Night uses a rather traditional Whorf-styled index <code>CPWYG</code> and <code>AEI</code> vowel block. There was a lot of experimentation trying to deviate from this norm, but it simply worked the best. Check the Theory section if you are interested in some of the other index options I tried.</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Nightingale</h2>
									<p>Nightingale is a modifcation of Night. It was actually the predecessor to Night and focused on same row maximization. Nightingale sacrifies the corner key usage for the removal of <code>V</code> from <code>FSV</code> and swaps <code>D</code> and <code>K</code> This creates a three-deadkey setup on the left hand. These keys are then placed on the top row, and corner key respectively. The index is also reordered with <code>WG</code> swap and <code>CS</code> swap. These changes in the layout pairs the left hand keys close to <code>L</code> (most common consoanat bigram), and right hand consoanats closer to <code>O</code> and <code>A</code> (extremely common bigrams).</p>
									<p>These swaps maximize same row bigrams, adjacent finger usage and cuts any non-index FSBs. This is often regarded as very comfortable; especially at high speeds.</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>History | Step-by-step</h2>
									<p><i>This section will feature the entire thought process from beginning to end of the design of Night and Nightingale. It will be one long block of text and is not important in understanding the layouts. However, if you plan on developing your own keyboard layout, you may want to consider this. This will also reference other keyboard layouts. If you see a weird word, it is probably that.</i></p>

									<h3>Chapter 1: PBLD</h3>
									<p>The design of Night began shortly after the full release of Dusk, and I, reaching 160 WPM (MT 60s) with Stern. Stern was originally designed months before and was my follow-up to Strand (a modification by me to Oxey's Sturdy_thumbn). Although Stern was a nice layout, especially having no corner key uage, the stacks used on Stern are rather high usage. <code>DTK</code> and <code>LHM</code> on ring and middle respectively are not ideal. So, after reaching 160 WPM, I started development on Nightingale. My layout style is almost always high alternation over high roll, and the same can be said for Nightingale. However, I still wanted to maximize same row interactions. I intended to use a <code>LH_</code> middle from the start (I just personally really like it), thus finding and placing keys that commonly interacted with <code>L</code> on the same row was a priority. The ones I initially settled on were: <code>P: Place, Plan, Play, Help, B: Blow, Black, Blue, Able, etc. D: Would, World, Could, Middle, etc.</code>. Nightingale focused on placing these keys (in relation to L) on the same row to encourage a same-row finger motion - a bigram roll persay. You may notice <code>P</code> being present in the list and <code>F</code> being absent. This is because the original layout, called PBLD, used <code>PNX, BNV, LHJ, DTMK</code> stacks with <code>DTMK</code> being arranged vertically. If you know anything about layout theory, this block has some problems. First, <code>PN</code> is not a great stack. Although very optimized in SFBs, a <code>PN</code> stack suffers in SFSs. Having this on the pinky is an especially bad idea. When I first published this layout, ddn, a very well known layout creator in the AKL discord, suggested to swap the keys around to have a <code>FBLD</code> setup. This fixes the SFSs and shifts <code>P</code> to the right index. At this point, the layout featured an <code>S</code> pinky and <code>N</code> ring, along with a vertically stacked <code>DTMK</code> index. The ideal of a vertically stacked <code>DTMK</code> was purely based upon effort keymaps. <code>D</code> had to be paired close to <code>L</code>, <code>M</code> was more common than <code>K</code>, and thus <code>M</code> was relegated to the bottom index curl position and <code>K</code> into the center column middle position. Although this is a seemingly good setup, it has a hidden problem: <code>M_D</code>. This SFS, although not the most common, is still very unideal. By placing these on the top and bottom row, you create a 2U SFS that is significantly worse than a normal SFS would be. Thus, the easiest way to fix this, which both Night and Nightingale adopts, is placing <code>M</code> in middle column middle position. This reduces the distance between <code>D</code> and <code>M</code> significantly, and still maintains good distance relations between the other keys (<code>K_D</code> is significantly rarer by more than half). I have to admit, this idea was inspired by Dusk. You sacrifice some traditional key position comfort for movement gains - much more beneficial in this context.</p>
									<hr />
									<h3>Chapter 2: Nightingale</h3>
									<p>Nightingale was finalized from ddn's suggestion to have an <code>FBLD</code> layout setup. Nightingale swaps the <code>FS | BN</code> stacks to create <code>BNX | FSV</code>. A small, but significant swap that further optimizes stats and comfort in usage. Next, to avoid FSBs, Nightingale swaps the <code>V</code> and <code>Z</code> keys to create a DTMKV index. You may remember from the previous section I discussed how having corner key usage is not ideal in such a high usage index. I still stand by that; However, this setup does remove all non-index FSBs as well as creating the three dead-key setup on the left hand. The stats hit from this are shown, however, if this no-full scissor setup is important to you, it may be worth the stats loss. Lastly, Nightingale uses a <code>Y</code> index as opposed to a <code>C</code> index. This setup, although just one swap, is actually more ideal compared to the <code>C</code> index Night uses. This is because <code>P_C</code> and <code>W_Y</code>, both common skipgrams, are now aligned instead of being diagonal. This leads to easier sliding (if you use that technique) and just reduces distance by a bit. To this day, I still regard Nightingale as the more interesting layout of the two. The, essentially, removal of FSBs, maximized same row usage, and still extremely low bad redirects makes it a very interesting layout to consider. I did actually use this; Check "My Review" for my thoughts - and why I switched away from it.</p>
									<hr />
									<h3>Chapter 3: Night</h3>
									<p>Night is the final iteration of the Night layout family. There are a few others in this family that will be listed in the mods section. The reason I do not directly mention them is due to them simply not performing well compared Night itself. Speaking of which, Night is but a simple swap from Nightingale. Creation of <code>FSV</code> ring, shifting of <code>D, W</code> into the curl positions (and related), <code>C</code> index, and that is about it. Going through each one, <code>FSV</code> was done simply because it provides better stats and I preferred tanking the scissors over more skipgrams. Similarily, the <code>D, W</code> swap into the curl positions was for comfort (especially on Dactyl which I was testing at the time) and, again, I do not mind scissors. Finally, the <code>C</code> index swap, albeit a little memes, was done specifically for English-200 (Monkeytype default corpus). <code>Y</code> is very under represented in the corpus, while <code>C</code> is a little over. This leads to an awkward situation where lateral stretch usage was higher than that of homekey usage. This problem was not present on "everyday typing," but was annoying enough that I decided to move away from it (check the mods section, I used a <code>F</code> index at one point). These three changes, although small, made a big enough difference in the typing experience that I felt they deserved seperate names. Night is the current layout I am using, and what I will use until I hit 200 WPM on MT 60s. Check "My Review" for more details, but this layout is where I likely will stay. There are a few awkward sequences such as <code>people</code> and the layout not being symmetrical in terms of movement, but it is more than good to use, and that is good enough for me.</p>
